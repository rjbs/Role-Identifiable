=head1 DESCRIPTION

Role::Identifiable isn't really a module that does anything.  It's here to make
things simpler for indexing on CPAN and looking up docs.

You probably want to use either L<Role::Identifiable::HasIdent>, for
identifying things by an identifier string, or L<Role::Identifiable::HasTags>
for identifying things by a list of tags.
